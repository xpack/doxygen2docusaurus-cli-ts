## AbstractCompoundDefType.sealed property

Indicates whether the compound is sealed.

**Signature:**

```typescript
sealed?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Specifies that the compound is sealed and cannot be inherited from, similar to final but using different language-specific terminology. This boolean attribute reflects sealed modifiers found in languages like C\# or other object-oriented programming environments.
