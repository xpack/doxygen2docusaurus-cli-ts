## IndexCompoundDataModel class

Concrete data model class for index compound elements.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class IndexCompoundDataModel extends AbstractIndexCompoundType 
```
**Extends:** [AbstractIndexCompoundType](./doxygen2docusaurus.abstractindexcompoundtype.md)

## Remarks

Represents individual compound elements found within Doxygen index XML structures. This class extends the abstract base to provide specific handling for 'compound' elements, which reference documented entities such as classes, namespaces, files, and other structural components within the indexed documentation. Each compound serves as an entry point for accessing detailed documentation in separate XML files.
