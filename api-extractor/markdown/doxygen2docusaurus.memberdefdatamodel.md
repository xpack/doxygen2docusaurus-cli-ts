## MemberDefDataModel class

Concrete implementation for memberdef elements within compound documentation.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class MemberDefDataModel extends AbstractMemberDefType 
```
**Extends:** [AbstractMemberDefType](./doxygen2docusaurus.abstractmemberdeftype.md)

## Remarks

Provides specific handling for memberdef XML elements that contain comprehensive member definition information within classes, structures, namespaces, and other compound types. This implementation extends the abstract base class functionality to process the complete range of member definitions including functions, variables, typedefs, enums, and specialised language constructs.

The class ensures proper instantiation of member definition data models whilst maintaining all the detailed metadata required for accurate documentation generation including cross-references, location information, and language-specific attributes.
