## AbstractMemberDefType.staticc property

Indicates whether the member is declared as static.

staticc: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating static member declaration, affecting the member's association with class instances versus the class itself. This information is crucial for understanding member accessibility and usage patterns.
