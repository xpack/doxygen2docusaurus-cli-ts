## AbstractLocationType.declfile property

The file path containing the declaration when separate from implementation.

**Signature:**

```typescript
declfile?: string | undefined;
```

## Remarks

File path for the declaration when it differs from the implementation file, typically occurring in header/source file pairs where declarations are placed in header files whilst implementations reside in source files. This separation is common in C/C++ development patterns.
