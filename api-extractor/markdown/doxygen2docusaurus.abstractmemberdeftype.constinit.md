## AbstractMemberDefType.constinit property

Indicates whether the member is declared as constinit.

**Signature:**

```typescript
constinit?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member must be initialized with a constant expression during static initialization. This C++20 feature helps prevent initialization order issues.
