## AbstractMemberDefType.noexcept property

Indicates whether the member is declared as noexcept.

**Signature:**

```typescript
noexcept?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member promises not to throw exceptions. This C++11 feature enables compiler optimizations and affects exception safety guarantees in the API design.
