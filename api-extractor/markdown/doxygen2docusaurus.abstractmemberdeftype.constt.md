## AbstractMemberDefType.constt property

Indicates whether the member is declared as const.

**Signature:**

```typescript
constt?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member is declared with the const qualifier, making it immutable after initialization. This affects the member's usage patterns and compiler optimizations.
