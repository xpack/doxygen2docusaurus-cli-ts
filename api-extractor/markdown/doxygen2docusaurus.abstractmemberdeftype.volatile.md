## AbstractMemberDefType.volatile property

Indicates whether the member is declared as volatile.

**Signature:**

```typescript
volatile?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member is declared with the volatile qualifier, preventing compiler optimizations that assume the value doesn't change unexpectedly. This is important for hardware registers and multi-threaded contexts.
