## AbstractMemberDefType.nodiscard property

Indicates whether the member is declared as nodiscard.

**Signature:**

```typescript
nodiscard?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member's return value should not be ignored by callers. This C++17 attribute helps prevent common programming errors where important return values are discarded.
