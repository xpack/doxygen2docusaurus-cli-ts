## AbstractMemberDefType.extern property

Indicates whether the member has external linkage.

**Signature:**

```typescript
extern?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member is declared with external linkage, typically using the 'extern' keyword in C/C++. This affects the member's visibility and linkage across translation units.
