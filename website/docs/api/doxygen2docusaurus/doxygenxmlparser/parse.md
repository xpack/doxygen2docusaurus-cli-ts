Parses all relevant Doxygen-generated XML files and constructs the internal data model.

## Signature

```typescript
parse(): Promise<DataModel>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[DataModel](/doxygen2docusaurus-ts/docs/api/doxygen2docusaurus/datamodel)<!-- -->&gt;

A promise that resolves to the populated data model

## Remarks

This method sequentially parses the main index XML file, all compound XML files referenced in the index, and the Doxyfile XML containing configuration options. The parser is configured to preserve the original content and element order for accuracy. The method also processes member definitions and logs progress and statistics, such as the number of files parsed and images identified, depending on the verbosity setting.
