Processes member definitions and updates member kinds where necessary.

## Signature

```typescript
processMemberdefs(): void;
```
**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

This method traverses all compound definitions and their associated sections. It collects member definitions by their identifiers and, for each member with an empty kind, assigns the kind from the corresponding member definition. This ensures that all members are correctly classified within the internal data model.
