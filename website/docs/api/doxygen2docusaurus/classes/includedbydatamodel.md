Data model for includedby elements within documentation content.

## Signature

```typescript
export declare class IncludedByDataModel extends AbstractIncType
```
**Extends:** [AbstractIncType](/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/docs/api/doxygen2docusaurus/classes/abstractinctype)

## Remarks

Represents includedby elements that document files which include the current source file. This implementation processes Doxygen's includedby elements, which contain information about files that incorporate the current file through preprocessor directives, establishing reverse inclusion relationships within the documentation system.

The includedby relationship indicates a dependency where other files incorporate content from the current file during compilation.
