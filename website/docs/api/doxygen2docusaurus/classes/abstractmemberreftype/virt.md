The virtual inheritance classification of the referenced member.

## Signature

```typescript
virt: string;
```

## Remarks

Indicates the virtual nature such as 'virtual', 'pure-virtual', or 'non-virtual' based on Doxygen's DoxVirtualKind enumeration. This classification is essential for understanding inheritance relationships and member override behaviour within class hierarchies.
