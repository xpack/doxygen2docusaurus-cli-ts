Indicates whether the compound is marked as final.

## Signature

```typescript
final?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Specifies that the compound cannot be inherited from or extended, typically used in object-oriented programming languages that support final classes or sealed types. This boolean attribute reflects the final modifier in the source code.
