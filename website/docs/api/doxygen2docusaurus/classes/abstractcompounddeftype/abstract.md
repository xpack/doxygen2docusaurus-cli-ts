Indicates whether the compound is abstract.

## Signature

```typescript
abstract?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Specifies that the compound is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly, typically requiring concrete implementations of abstract methods or properties. This boolean attribute reflects abstract modifiers in object-oriented programming languages.
