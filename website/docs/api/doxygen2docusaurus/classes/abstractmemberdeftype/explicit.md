Indicates whether the member is declared as explicit.

## Signature

```typescript
explicit?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that constructors or conversion operators are marked as explicit, preventing implicit conversions. This is particularly important for type safety in C++ class design.
