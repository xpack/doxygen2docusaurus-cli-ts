<!-- Do not edit this file. It is automatically generated by API Documenter. -->



Indicates whether the member is declared as consteval.

## Signature

```typescript
consteval?: boolean | undefined;
```

## Remarks

Boolean flag indicating that the member must be evaluated at compile time. This C++20 feature is stronger than constexpr, requiring immediate evaluation during compilation.
