Indicates whether the include uses local or system include syntax.

## Signature

```typescript
local: boolean;
```

## Remarks

Determines the include syntax style: when true, indicates a local include using quotation marks ("filename"), when false, indicates a system include using angle brackets (<filename>). This distinction affects how the preprocessor searches for the included file.
