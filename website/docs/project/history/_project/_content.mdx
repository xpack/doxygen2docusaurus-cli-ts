### November 2024

The project was initiated as an experimental undertaking, motivated by curiosity regarding the structure and content of Doxygen XML files.

The initial implementation comprised a Docusaurus plugin that generated Docusaurus `.mdx` files incorporating React components.

### June 2025

Given that Doxygen may embed arbitrary HTML code within documentation pages, whilst the MDX syntax enforces strict constraints and does not accommodate all HTML elements, the project was subsequently revised to generate CommonMark `.md` files.

### July 2025

Since Docusaurus does not guarantee ordered plugin initialisation, it proved impossible to devise an elegant solution for executing the conversion process prior to the documentation build phase.

The solution adopted involved transforming the project into a command-line interface (CLI) application, enabling execution as a pre-build step before the Docusaurus build process commences.

### August 2025

The first public release was published.
