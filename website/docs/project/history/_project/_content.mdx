### November 2024

The project was initiated as an experimental endeavour, driven by curiosity
regarding the structure and content of Doxygen XML files.

The initial implementation took the form of a Docusaurus plugin that
generated Docusaurus `.mdx` files incorporating React components.

### June 2025

Given that Doxygen may embed arbitrary HTML code within documentation pages,
whilst the MDX syntax enforces strict constraints and does not accommodate
all HTML elements, the project was subsequently revised to generate
CommonMark `.md` files.

### July 2025

Due to Docusaurus not guaranteeing ordered plugin initialisation, it proved
impossible to devise an elegant solution for executing the conversion
process prior to the documentation build phase.

The adopted solution involved transforming the project into a command-line
interface (CLI) application, enabling execution as a pre-build step before
the Docusaurus build process commences.

### August 2025

The first public release was published.
