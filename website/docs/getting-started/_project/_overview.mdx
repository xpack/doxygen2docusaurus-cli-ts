The **doxygen2docusaurus** project is a command-line tool that bridges the gap between Doxygen-generated API documentation and modern Docusaurus websites. It converts Doxygen XML output into CommonMark files optimised for Docusaurus, enabling seamless integration of comprehensive API reference documentation within your project's documentation site. The tool maintains the rich structure and cross-references of Doxygen documentation whilst presenting it in Docusaurus's clean, modern interface.

**doxygen2docusaurus** is designed to be executed on the development machine where the website is maintained.
