[Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl) is the **industry standard** for generating API documentation from annotated **C/C++** source code.

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is a **modern documentation website generator** that provides a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for creating documentation sites.

**doxygen2docusaurus** is a command-line tool that bridges the gap between Doxygen-generated API documentation and modern Docusaurus websites. It **converts Doxygen XML** output into **CommonMark** files optimised for Docusaurus, enabling **seamless integration** of comprehensive API reference documentation within project documentation sites.

## Features & Benefits

### High quality documentation pages

The tool leverages Docusaurus's **clean**, **modern interface** to generate visually appealing and **professional-grade documentation pages**. (The images are from the [ÂµTest++](https://micro-os-plus.github.io/micro-test-plus-xpack) project)

### Enhanced navigation experience

To improve the user navigation experience, for each reference sub-site, the tool generates a **dropdown menu** for the top navigation bar and a **sidebar**. For each page, it also creates the headers necessary for the **table of contents**.

### Flexible topic-based structure

Doxygen enables **grouping of API reference documentation by topics**, and **doxygen2docusaurus** prioritises rendering these topic pages with enhanced structural organisation. This functionality improves documentation accessibility, facilitating efficient information retrieval. Each topic page is systematically organised into distinct sections, with comprehensive indices presented at the beginning of each page to enable rapid navigation.

### Streamlined documentation workflow

**doxygen2docusaurus** is a versatile CLI application that can be employed in virtually any scenario, from manual invocation to automated CI/CD environments, with the generated pages either forming part of the repository or being created dynamically during website publishing.

However, the recommended approach is to **execute the tool on the development machine** where the website is maintained, allowing the resulting CommonMark files to be seamlessly integrated into existing Docusaurus sites and **stored within the project repository**.

Whilst this approach requires additional repository space, the significant advantage lies in enabling straightforward tracking of documentation changes.
