## Status

The `@xpack/doxygen2docusaurus` project is functional but it is still young and may require further development and refinement.

### Demo sites

During development, several sites were employed to test and validate the converter.

#### Doxygen website

The primary demonstration site is a replica of Doxygen's own [website](https://doxygen.nl/), which was originally divided into two separate sites: the user manual and the reference documentation. Both have been consolidated into a single Docusaurus site featuring two reference sub-sites.

The Doxygen replica site is publicly available in the [xpack/web-doxygen](https://github.com/xpack/web-doxygen) repository and the site is available at [https://xpack.github.io/web-doxygen/](https://xpack.github.io/web-doxygen/).

#### LLVM API reference

The [LLVM API reference](https://llvm.org/doxygen/) is another example of a site that has been successfully converted using **doxygen2docusaurus**.

Unfortunately, the site is exceptionally large (20,000+ pages, 1GB+), and Docusaurus does not handle such large sites effectively (builds require considerable time and memory consumption is very high), rendering it unsuitable as an exemplar for a Docusaurus site.

The LLVM replica site is publicly available in the [xpack/web-llvm](https://github.com/xpack/web-llvm) repository.

#### µTest++ project

The first production-grade website featuring reference pages generated by **doxygen2docusaurus** is the [µTest++](https://xpack.github.io/micro-test-plus-xpack/) project, which is a C++ unit testing framework.

## tsdoc2docusaurus

The [tsdoc2docusaurus](https://github.com/xpack/tsdoc2docusaurus-cli-ts) project is a companion project that provides functionality to convert [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) reference pages to Docusaurus `.md` files.

Whilst it is less refined and not yet available as an npm package, it is largely functional and can be employed to document TypeScript projects that utilise TSDoc comments. The API pages of this website serve as an example of its output.
