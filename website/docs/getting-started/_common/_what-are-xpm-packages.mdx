## What are xpm packages? (xPacks) {#xpm-packages}

**xpm packages**, also known as **xPacks**, are highly adaptable and
language-neutral software solutions. They have been effectively employed
in C and C++ projects, demonstrating their versatility and practicality.

<summary>What the heck are xpm packages (xPacks)? Please, do not introduce another package format!</summary>

At first glance, the use of xpm packages may appear complex; however,
in practice, they are remarkably straightforward. Their design philosophy
is centred on automating frequent tasks in software development,
such as dependency installation, and ensuring reproducibility.

xpm packages are managed by **[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)**
(the xPack Project Manager), a
utility that complements the **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/)**
CLI, the widely-utilised JavaScript
package manager, by introducing language-neutral features.

The xPacks Framework **does not establish a new package format**.
Instead, it **adopts the standard npm package format**, which comprises
a collection of files and folders, along with a `package.json`
file containing the metadata.

**xpm** is capable of installing packages from the same repositories
as **npm**, whether they are public or private.

Packages, which are typically regular archives or git repositories,
are extracted into distinct folders within the project.

Based on their contents, xpm packages fall into two categories:

- Source xpm packages: These contain source libraries.
- Binary xpm packages: These typically consist of executables,
often platform-specific binary tools.

**Source xpm packages** are standard npm packages that incorporate
**library source files**, usually written in C/C++, although they
are not restricted to any particular programming language.

**Binary xpm packages** are also standard npm packages but have
minimal contents, generally limited to a `package.json` file.
Since these packages provide executables for multiple platforms —
many of which can be considerably large — it is impractical to
include all binaries within the npm package itself. Instead, the
`package.json` file includes references (URLs) to platform-specific
binary archives (e.g., `.tar.gz` for Unix or `.zip` for Windows).

These archives, along with the package metadata, are extracted.
Additionally, links or forwarders to the executables are created
within a `.bin` folder, thereby eliminating the need to add multiple
folders to the system PATH.

In conclusion, xpm packages simplify and streamline the installation
process for source libraries and tools, enhancing efficiency and
automation. For further information, please refer to the
