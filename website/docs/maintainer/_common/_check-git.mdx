### Check Git

In the `xpack/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts` Git repository:

- Switch to the `development` branch
- Pull new changes
- If necessary, **merge** the `master` branch
- If necessary, **merge** the `website` branch

:::caution

This is critically important; otherwise you will release the previous content again!

:::

The `master` branch should remain unchanged since the previous release
and will be updated when the new release is published.
