# How to obtain help for doxygen2docusaurus

## Quick links

The most efficient approach is to utilise the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/discussions)
pages.

## Web page issues

If you encounter any issues within the content of these pages (such as typographical errors or
incorrect phrasing) or have suggestions for improving the documentation,
please share them through the
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/discussions)
pages.
Ensure you provide the full URL of the page, clearly identify the
section with the problematic content, and suggest improvements.

## Check documentation

As usual, before asking anything, it is advisable to review the project
documentation.
