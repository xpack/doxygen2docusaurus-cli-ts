## Add links for development

During development, it is convenient to have a writable instance of the
module to make changes in parallel with the parent project.

To facilitate the use of a writable instance of this library in other
projects, add a link from the user's global xPacks store to this local
development folder:

```sh
npm link -C ~/Work/xpack/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts.git
```

And in the projects referring it:

```sh
npm link @xpack/doxygen2docusaurus
```
