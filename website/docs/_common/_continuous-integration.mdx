The library is subject to continuous integration (CI) testing with every
push utilising [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/actions).
This ensures compatibility and stability across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
operating systems.

Testing is conducted on both 32-bit and 64-bit bare-metal platforms,
including Arm Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M7F, Cortex-A15,
Cortex-A72, RISC-V RV32IMAC, and RV64IMAFDC. Additionally, native
testing is performed utilising GCC and LLVM/clang compilers, ensuring
comprehensive validation across various environments.
