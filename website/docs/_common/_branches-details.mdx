The project uses multiple branches:

- `master`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `development`, with the current development version
- `website`, with the current content of the website; pushes to this branch automatically trigger publishes the main website

All development is done in the `development` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `development` branch is merged
into `master`.
