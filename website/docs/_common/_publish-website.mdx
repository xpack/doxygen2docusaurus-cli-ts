### Publish the website

The website deployment is performed automatically when pushing to the
`website` branch, utilising a dedicated workflow in
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/actions/workflows/publish-github-pages.yml).

- Open https://xpack.github.io/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/docs/maintainer/#publish-the-website in a separate window
- Stop the local web server
- Switch to the `website` branch
- **Merge** the `development` branch into the `website` branch
- **Push** the `website` branch to GitHub
  :::info
  At this point, an automated GitHub Action will generate and publish the website.
  :::
- Check out the `development` branch
- Wait for the publication to complete
- Refresh the web page
- The new release blog post is available
at https://xpack.github.io/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/blog/
- Record the post URL, as it must be used to update the release page
and the X/Twitter announcement

The `website` branch may be subsequently updated, provided the
version in `package.json` remains unchanged.

Verify the result at https://xpack.github.io/doxygen2docusaurus-cli-ts/.
