<summary>Reproducibility and `dependencies`</summary>

To ensure reproducibility, it is essential for each project to always
utilise the exact desired versions of the required libraries, regardless of the
libraries installed in the system.

To achieve this objective, **xpm** records all locally installed packages
as dependencies in the project `package.json` file.

The result appears as follows:

<CodeBlock language="json"> {
`  "xpack": {
    "minimumXpmRequired": "0.20.7",
    "dependencies": {
      "@xpack/doxygen2docusaurus": {
        "specifier": "1.1.0",
        "local": "link",
        "platforms": "all"
      }
    },
    "devDependencies": {},
    "properties": {},
    "actions": {},
    "buildConfigurations": {}
  }
`} </CodeBlock>

If the `package.json` is saved in the revision system, the above
definition acts as a firm reference to the specific version of
doxygen2docusaurus.

After cloning the project into a different location, the command `xpm install`
may be used to install all dependencies.

This is particularly useful for CI/CD environments.
