<summary>Installation details</summary>

The above `xpm install` command will perform the following:

* identify the desired version
  of @xpack/doxygen2docusaurus, download it into a cache and unpack
  it into a versioned folder
  within the **user's global xPacks store** (if not already present);
  check the output of the `xpm install` command for the actual
  folder used on your platform;
* create a local symbolic link
  such as <code>xpacks/@xpack/doxygen2docusaurus</code> pointing to the
  versioned folder in the user's global xPacks store
* add <code>@xpack/doxygen2docusaurus</code> to
  `package.json` as a
  dependency; this associates a specific version of doxygen2docusaurus with
  the current project (details below).

:::tip

The installation location may be configured using the
`XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` environment variable; for more details please refer to the
[xpm folders](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/folders/) page.
