<summary>xpm packages (xPacks) refresher</summary>

**xpm packages**, abbreviated as **xPacks**, are general-purpose,
language-neutral software packages.
They use **the same format as npm packages**,
which is a collection of files/folders
and a `package.json` file with the package metadata.

**xpm** can install source and binary packages.

For more details, please see the previous explanation in the
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/#xpm-packages) page.
