## Do not install npm with administrative rights!

Installing **npm** with administrative rights is strongly discouraged,
as it results in all other CLI programmes (including **xpm**)
being installed with administrative rights as well.
Instead, utilise a Node.js version manager.

For completeness, the official page explaining how to install **npm** within
a custom folder is
[Resolving EACCES permissions errors when installing packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
