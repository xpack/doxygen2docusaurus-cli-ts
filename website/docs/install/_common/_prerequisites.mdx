### Prerequisites

The only requirement for an automated install is a recent
[xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/), which is a portable
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) command line application
that complements [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com)
with several extra features specific to
**C/C++ projects**.

To install **xpm**,
follow the instructions in the
[xpm install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page.

If already installed, it is always a good idea to update it to the
latest version with:

```sh
npm install --location=global xpm@latest
```

:::tip

Although not mandated by **xpm**, it is also a good idea to upgrade
**npm** to the latest version, and
**node** to a reasonably recent version (currently **npm** requires
a **node** >=18.17.0).

<details>
<summary>Local installs</summary>

One of the xPack design goals is to allow each project to
choose the exact versions of the libraries it requires.

Similarly to **npm** being able to install specific versions of the
JavaScript tools into each project,
**xpm** was also designed to be able to install specific versions of the
required libraries locally into each project.

Therefore, similarly to the way **npm** installs the JavaScript packages into
`node_modules`, **xpm** installs the libraries into
`xpacks`. Here there will be separate folders with the installed
packages, for example
<code>xpacks/@xpack/doxygen2docusaurus</code>.
