### Initialise the project

Upon initial use, ensure that a `package.json` file is present in the
project root folder.

This can be achieved by running `xpm init` in the desired project folder
(substitute `my-project` accordingly):

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init
```

<summary>Under the hood</summary>

The main purpose of `xpm init` is to create a `package.json` file, if not
already present.

In addition to `name` & `version`, the minimal `package.json` must
include a property named `xpacks`, even empty. This property is
mandatory to identify the package as an **xpm package**.
